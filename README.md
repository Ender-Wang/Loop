</div>

Loop is a MacOS app made to help you manage your windows. Utilizing a radial menu when triggered, all you have to do is select a direction with your cursor then release the trigger key. Loop also contains a lot of customization options, so that you can personalize nearly everything to your likings.

## Triggering Loop

You can set your own custom trigger key for Loop! To use caps lock, you will need to remap it to control in System Settings, as shown above. This will need to be repeated with every keyboard connected to your Mac. Note that even though you're remapping it to control, Loop won't trigger from the actual control key :)

	<h1>Loop</h1>
	<p><em>The missing window manager from the stock MacOS experience</em></p>
</div>

Loop is a MacOS app made to help you manage your windows. Utilizing a radial menu when triggered, all you have to do is select a direction with your cursor then release the trigger key. It also contains a lot of customization options, so that you can personalize nearly everything to your likings, such as custom keybindings to resize windows!

## Installation

**Compatible with MacOS 12 and later**

Simply download the latest release [here](https://github.com/MrKai77/Loop/releases/latest)! It will prompt you to move it to the Applications folder, and for accessibility access, and then you're all set!  
Installation with `brew` is planned.


## Triggering Loop

You can set your own custom trigger key for Loop! Currently, the available options for triggering loop are:
- `Left Control`
- `Left Option`
- `Right Option`
- `Right Command`
- `Caps Lock` ([Additinal setup needed](#using-caps-lock))
- `Function`

### Using Caps Lock

To use the `Caps Lock` key as your trigger key, you will need to remap it to Control in System Settings, as shown above. This will need to be repeated with every keyboard connected to your Mac. Note that even though you're remapping it to control, Loop won't trigger from the actual control key :)

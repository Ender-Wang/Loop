# Triggering Loop

You can set your own custom trigger key for Loop! Currently, the available options for triggering loop are:

- `Left Option`
- `Right Option`
- `Right Command`
- `Caps Lock` ([Additional setup needed](#using-caps-lock))
- `Function`

### Using Caps Lock

To set Caps Lock as the trigger key, remap it to Control in System Settings, and repeat the process for every connected keyboard. Note that Loop won't be triggered by the actual Control key, despite the remapping. :)
